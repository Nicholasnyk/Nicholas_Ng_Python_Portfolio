# READ ME: THIS SCRIPT CHECKS IF A LETTER IS FOUND WITHIN A CERTAIN WORD. TECHNICALLY IT COULD ALSO BE A NUMBER WITH THE STRING DATA TYPE BUT WORDS DON'T CONTAIN NUMERICALS. RETURNS THE INDEX OF THE WORD THAT CONTAINS THE LETTER
# IMPORTANT: LIST CANNOT CONTAIN NUMERICAL TYPES. ONLY ACCEPTS STRINGS. CHANGE list AND letter AS PER DESIRED


list = ['word','dog','tyrant','old']
letter = 'a'.casefold()
word_index = []

for index, word in enumerate(list):
    if letter in word:
        word_index.append(index)
print(word_index)
