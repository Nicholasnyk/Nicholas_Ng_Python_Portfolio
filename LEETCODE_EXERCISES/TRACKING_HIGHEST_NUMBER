# READ ME: THIS SCRIPT CHECKS AND AGGREGATES NUMBERS FROM A LIST OF LISTS THAT CONTAINS DIGITS AND STORE THEM IN A DICTIONARY FOR COMPARISSON AND DETERMINING THE HIGHEST BIDDER AND ITS INDEX IN THE LIST
# SCOPE: THIS EXERCISE USES THE EXAMPLE OF HAVING A LIST OF CLIENTS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE BANK ACCOUNTS. THE GOAL IS TO AGGREGATE THEIR TOTAL WEALTH AND DETERMINE WHAT THE HIGHEST WEALTH IS AND AS A BONUS I ADDED THE INDEX OF THE WEALTHIEST USER
# IMPORTANT: JUST MODIFY THE LIST accounts TO PLAY AROUND WITH IT. CLIENT NO. 1 MEANS CLIENT AT INDEX 0 IN THE LIST
