# READ ME: THIS IS A SCRIPT THAT RETURNS THE INDEX OF TWO NUMBERS WITHIN A LIST THAT WHEN COMBINED TOGETHERS RETURN THE TARGET NUMBER. THIS CAN BE MODIFIED TO ACCEPT MORE DIGITS IN THE SUMMATION
# ATTENTION: TO MAKE IT WORK SIMPLY CALL THE FUNCTION 'twoSum' ALONG WITH ITS FIRST ARGUMENT : A LIST OF NUMBERS AND SECOND ARGUMENT: A TARGET NUMBER. EXAMPLE twoSum(arg1:list,arg2:target_num)
# IMPORTANT: NUMBERS IN THE LIST ARE CONSIDERED SINGLE INSTANCES AND ARE PROGRAMMED NOT TO BE ADDED WITH THEMSELVES. EXAMPLE [1,3,4,5] TARGET NUMBER = 2 WILL RETURN NO INDEX AS 1 IN INDEX 0 CAN'T BE ADDED WITH ITSELF
